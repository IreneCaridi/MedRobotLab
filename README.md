# Robotics Lab 

First thing first, clone the sam2 repository from meta, as we are working with it:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git
```
Also rember to download the requirements from sam2:

```
cd sam2
pip install -e .
```
Sam2 is already put into .gitignore, so it should be fine, but remember to delete the .git folder inside sam2, 
just to be sure.
